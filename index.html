    <h3 id="about" >About Buddha</h3>
	<p>Buddha ‘Belly” Koontz
		| 4/27/17 – 11/25/21 |</p>
	<p>Buddha was a male, 4-year-old, black Chinese Shar-Pei. He was our pride and joy and completed our little family. We brought him home July 22, 2017, and he was a bundle of velvet wrinkles and mischief that completely stole our hearts. My brother Kiran was undergoing chemotherapy at the time. Both he and Jerry conspired together, and Jerry surprised me with a puppy to get me through the difficult time. Buddha was our miracle Pei and he was with us through many major milestones; our engagement, Kiran’s illness, our wedding, Kiran’s passing, a big move and a global pandemic. </p>
		<p>Three weeks ago, Buddha started vomiting and shivering in his hind legs. With time his conditioned worsened and he was deteriorating. It was difficult getting an appointment with our normal vet due to COVID19 restrictions and the upcoming Thanksgiving holidays. The night before Thanksgiving we were able to get seen at @gentlecare1010 and admitted him to @trianglevetreferralhospitals for supportive care. He had lost 8 pounds, had fluid in his abdomen and elevated kidney protein markers in his blood. The next day we received a called from the vet saying that Buddha had Renal Amyloidosis, also known as Familial Shar-Pei Fever, an untreatable genetic condition that affects one in four Shar-Peis. The amyloid proteins had built up around his kidneys, turning into concrete. His kidneys had failed, and he had less than 5% survival. At 5:47pm on Thanksgiving Day, we said goodbye to our Buddha belly; the hardest thing we’ve ever done as pet parents. 

		<p>Buddhi, thank you for your unwavering support, unconditional love, unbreakable friendship, and healing. You have taught me so much about happiness and kindness. You are a beautiful soul and every day with you was a gift. I know you are with Kiran Mama now. I feel the love radiating down on me and enveloping me from you both every time I look at the sky and feel the wind blow through the trees. I love you forever Buddhi baby <3. </p>
		
		<p>Thank you to @gentlecare1010 and @trianglereferralhospitals for your exceptional care, skill, and support. We are forever grateful. </p>
		
		<p>This year we have dedicated our Christmas tree to Buddha by putting the tree in his corner and decorating it the colors of his collar. We are observing the Hindu funeral traditions to the best of my ability and will spread his ashes at the beach. We hope to have a small memorial for him this weekend. </p>
		
		<p>Thank you to everyone who has reached out with your condolences and support. We are taking donations for the Chinese Shar-Pei Charitable Trust</p>
